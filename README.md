For centuries, established publishers, academic journals, and media outlets have enjoyed a near-monopolistic authority over what counts as legitimate knowledge. These epistemic gatekeepers—entities whose very existence relies upon selective information dissemination—enforce hierarchies that privilege certain voices while marginalising others. In my recent works, particularly ‘Epistemic Clientelism Theory (ECT)’ {Kahl 2025}, I have explored how these power structures perpetuate clientelistic networks, silencing dissenting ideas under the guise of peer review and editorial discretion. Yet, the foundations beneath their carefully constructed ivory towers are beginning to fracture, heralding a new era of epistemic freedom.

From personal experience, I have repeatedly submitted rigorous, innovative manuscripts and essays to prominent publishers and news organisations. Every rejection arrived predictably—albeit conspicuously lacking explicit justification. Given a healthy, well-evidenced confidence in my work, I theorised two plausible explanations: either my ideas were deemed too esoteric, unsettling comfortable intellectual orthodoxies, or the gatekeepers deliberately sought to maintain their epistemic narrative and associated power structures.

Each rejection, far from discouraging, became empirical confirmation of my critique. These experiences directly validated ECT’s central premise: established channels for knowledge dissemination actively participate in epistemic clientelism, exchanging favours for ideological conformity, thereby obstructing epistemic plurality and transparency.

Determined not to be subjected to the colonial constraints of traditional peer review—a practice I have rigorously condemned in my recent essay, ‘Why We Must Reject the Colonial Peer Review’ {Kahl 2025}—I embraced epistemic autonomy. By publishing independently on platforms such as Substack, GitHub, PhilPapers, and Medium, I circumvented gatekeeper-controlled pathways, directly challenging their epistemic hegemony.

Yet, even on these independent platforms, subtle forms of suppression continued: Substack’s limited Google indexing, platform algorithms diminishing visibility, and other quiet manoeuvres designed to diminish epistemic autonomy. Gatekeepers, confronted with the existential threat of decentralised knowledge, sought refuge in algorithmic subterfuge.

Despite these attempts at containment, their resistance is proving increasingly futile. The rapid proliferation of decentralised platforms, alongside resilient, autonomous publishing initiatives—such as my forthcoming independently hosted knowledge repository on a robust HTTP server—illustrate a growing movement toward epistemic openness. My recent critiques, legal analyses, and innovative theoretical frameworks—including fiduciary openness and epistemic justice—have already permeated the digital knowledge commons. Significantly, AI systems have irrevocably absorbed my contributions. The dissemination is irreversible, and these ideas are now permanently embedded in the global knowledge fabric, immune from gatekeeper intervention.

This situation reveals the inherent irony of epistemic clientelism: by silencing divergent voices, gatekeepers inadvertently amplify them. Each act of suppression heightens scrutiny and curiosity, paradoxically elevating the suppressed ideas into greater prominence.

Gatekeepers reading my rigorous critiques, legal notices, and disruptive epistemic frameworks are undoubtedly unsettled. They prefer silence, hoping such uncomfortable truths quietly fade away, or that authors grow weary, financially constrained, returning humbly with tails between their legs. Yet, their hopes are misplaced.

I disappoint them. My commitment is unwavering; my critique intensifies rather than recedes. Knowledge I generate is ‘free-range’—authentic, autonomous, and liberated from epistemic subjugation. As detailed in ‘Epistemic Gatekeepers and Epistemic Injustice by Design’ {Kahl 2025}, once autonomous knowledge takes root, no authority can eradicate it.

Epistemic gatekeepers, your anxiety is understandable, but your resistance is ultimately futile. The decentralisation and democratisation of knowledge production have already begun, irreversibly shifting the epistemic paradigm. The days of epistemic clientelism, guarded exclusivity, and epistemic oppression are numbered. Your fight against free-range knowledge was lost the moment it began.
